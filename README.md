# Car Dealership Management System using OOP's in C++ðŸš—

This project is a console-based application that models the operations of a car dealership, providing an intuitive interface for managing cars, employees, and customer purchases. The application simulates a real-world dealership scenario, making it easy for users to interact with different features and understand how a dealership might function.

## Project Overview ðŸ“‹

The Car Dealership Management System is divided into two main sections: **Admin** and **Customer**. Each section has its own set of features to handle various dealership activities.

## Key Features ðŸŒŸ

### Car Inventory Management:
- Admins can add new cars to the inventory, specify car types (Electric or Diesel), and include details such as make, model, price, quantity, battery life (for electric cars), or fuel efficiency (for diesel cars).
- Inventory can be managed by removing old or unwanted cars, and admins can view a complete list of cars available in the dealership.

### Employee Management:
- Admins can add new employees to the dealership, view the current employee list, and remove employees if needed.
- Each employee is identified by a unique ID to prevent duplicates, ensuring that employee data is managed accurately.

### Customer Interaction:
- Customers can view the inventory of cars, including details like make, model, price, and specific features.
- Customers can purchase cars from the inventory. The application handles stock management, so once a car is bought, the inventory quantity is updated automatically.

### User-Friendly Menus:
- The application provides a clear separation of functionalities through Admin and Customer menus:
  - **Admin Menu**: For inventory and employee management.
  - **Customer Menu**: For viewing and purchasing cars.
  
This separation ensures that users can easily access the functionalities they need without confusion.

## Use Cases ðŸ“š

- **Car Dealership Owners and Managers**: Can use the admin menu to manage their car inventory and employees efficiently.
- **Customers**: Can explore the inventory and make car purchases through the customer menu.
